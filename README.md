Well it's that time of year...Hacktoberfest - https://hacktoberfest.com/ - to take a break and a chance to learn something new for swag (:tshirt:) or plant a tree :deciduous_tree:.  This is an annual event occurring in October.

## This year...

I'm going to learn how to use <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform" target="_blank">Digitial Ocean's App Platform</a> to understand how it compares to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/" target="_blank">Azure App Service</a> features and ease-of-use.  I've used App Service for production applications, so this will be a stripped-down quickstart comparision.
