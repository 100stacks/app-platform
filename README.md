Well it's that time of year...Hacktoberfest - https://hacktoberfest.com/ - to take a break and a chance to learn something new for swag (:tshirt:) or plant a tree :deciduous_tree:.

## This year...

I'm going to learn how to use <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform" target="_blank">Digitial Ocean's App Platform</a> to understand how it compares to MS's Azure App Service in ease-of-use.
